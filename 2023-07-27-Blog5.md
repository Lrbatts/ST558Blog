## Future of R

I believe that R as a program should continue to grow in usage for
statistical and data science use for analysis projects. It continues to
develop and be more compatible with other software such as github for
sharing and collaboration of projects. There are so many ways to go
about different analyses and there is a great community to seek help
when you get stuck. As for me, personally, I will continue to use R for
future projects as I am most familiar with it and love many of its
features.

## Course Overview and Future

This course has taught me many different methods for going about
analysis and now I have a good understanding of how to approach data
exploration. After taking the course, I realize I now map out my ideas
for what I want the project to look like rather than just guessing and
checking and hoping the code turns out right. It has really helped my
process and made me become more efficient as a coder. As for future
projects, I grew up loving sports and would love to be able to apply my
knowledge to produce interesting analyses for sports analytics and
potentially work in the sports industry.
